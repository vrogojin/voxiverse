class_name WorldManager
extends Node3D
## Owns "the world": picks the rendering path, drives streaming, and exposes the
## analytic queries (solidity, surface height, voxel raycast) that the player and
## HUD use regardless of path. Also holds the decoupled sim layer (material
## registry + per-voxel environment) so gameplay reads simulation, not geometry.
##
## Path selection (DESIGN §2): if the Zylann godot_voxel module is compiled into
## the running engine (ClassDB has VoxelTerrain), use it; otherwise fall back to
## the pure-GDScript chunk streamer. Both render the same infinite grass hills
## from TerrainConfig, so everything downstream is identical.

## Emitted when a cell's per-cell METADATA is DROPPED by a material change or break
## (VOXEL-DATA-STRUCTURE §14 P1 / §11): `_write_cell` settles the orphaned document
## through this signal so a future system (e.g. spilling a chest's contents as
## pickups) can react. No consumer is required today. Never fired by `set_state`
## (the one write that PRESERVES metadata) or by `set_metadata` (an explicit update).

# --- loose-body gate (PERF, GroundCollider exploration-jerkiness fix) ----------
# The ground collider exists ONLY to catch loose VoxelBodies; the player moves analytically and
# never touches it. So the collider is gated on whether any loose body is present/near — with none,
# it does zero rebuild work. Every loose VoxelBody is a DIRECT child of this WorldManager (both
# spawn paths — spawn_loose(self, …) and VoxelBody._spawn_detached via get_parent()), so the set is
# just the VoxelBody children; deriving it on demand (no signal/_ready dependency) is robust in the
# game AND the headless verify (where _ready is deferred). The set is tiny (typically 0–a few), so
# the per-frame scan is negligible.

## Metres around a terrain/body edit within which dormant debris is woken (dormant-by-default
## reactivation). Generous enough to catch a local debris pile so a whole small stack reactivates
## together; a rare taller stack self-heals on the next nearby edit.

## True iff an AWAKE loose VoxelBody is within `radius` columns (Chebyshev, horizontal) of `center`.

## bodies still sit there — a pile of settled debris near the player costs nothing. Only a moving/

# seen. Dense LRIDs never travel — they are container-local, translated by GMID at the boundary
# (RMS §2.1). This is additive; nothing in the live loop calls it (gameplay is byte-identical).
# Transport / signing / trust are out of scope (RMS §9.3): this is the payload FORMAT only.

## Serialize the edit overlay (+ per-cell metadata) within `regions` (each a 32-aligned origin,
## use `region_origin_of`) into a self-contained ZoneBundle. Each present cell is recorded by its
## cross-session "<gmid>#<state>" key (`ZoneChunk.set_cell_keyed`), and every referenced material's
## document is gathered into the bundle manifest (from the content store when held, else
## reconstructed byte-identically from the catalog def, RMS §2.2). Regions with no edits are
## skipped. Container-local ids are compact (per-chunk palettes) and independent of this session's
